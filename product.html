            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Basil is one of the most common herbs used in cooking. Its scientific name is Ocimum Basilicum and is also commonly called sweet basil.  which is an annual herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae). Grown for its aromatic leaves, Basil is believed to be native to India and is widely grown as a kitchen herb. The leaves are used fresh or dried to flavor meats, fish, salads, and sauces. It can also be consumed as basil tea that effects as a stimulant for a variety of effects. From appetite to diuretic, also as a stimulant for lactation and blood circulation for women who are pregnant and even after giving birth.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In cooking, Basil is most commonly used and popular among Italian cuisine. It is used basically as a sauce as in pesto and can also be combined with other tomato-based pasta sauces to give more flavor. It also has a bright and powerful flavor that pairs well with the deep flavors of beef dishes. It is delicious when cooked into a recipe, but best if added towards the end of the cooking time to brighten the dish and add a new facet of flavor. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The pesto, as mentioned earlier, is one of the most common and simplest recipes for Basil. It is simply a mix of fresh ground or minced basil leaves, garlic, and olive oil. It can be taken as a dip or sauce in itself and could be great with chips and other snacks. Could also be used as a fresh salad dressing or even as a spread for a refreshing sandwich for snack or lunch. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Other cuisines or dishes that commonly use Basil are in a variety of Mediterranean and Asian dishes, ranging from creamy sauces to light, herbaceous salads and spicy curries. Ingredients that are complemented by the addition of Basil include meats like chicken and beef, olive oil, eggs, tomatoes, and herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Basil is most aromatic when used fresh, but fresh basil should be added at the end of cooking, as excessive heat will significantly deplete the flavor or even cause the herb to turn bitter. Dried basil is preferred for use throughout the cooking process, as the flavor wonâ€™t be significantly altered by the heat.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Aside from cooking, Basil gives a whole lot of benefits as a medicinal herb. Some of the major ones include  being:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Good For Digestion
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>According to the book , 'Healing Foods' by DK Publishing, basil can facilitate optimal digestion. "Basil fortifies the digestive and nervous system and can be a good remedy for headaches and insomnia," notes the book. The eugenol present in the leaves ensures anti-inflammatory action in the digestive tract. Basil helps balance acid within the body and restores the body's proper pH level.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2. Anti-inflammatory
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Basil and its strong anti-inflammatory properties can prove to be a cure to a variety of diseases and disorders. The powerful essential oils, including eugenol, citronellol and linalool, help lower inflammation through their enzyme inhibiting properties. The anti-inflammatory properties of basil may help lower risk of heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel conditions. Consumption of basil could also soothe fever, headache, sore throat, cold, cough, flu. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3. Antioxidant
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>According to the book 'Healing Foods', the culinary herb contains a range of natural antioxidants, which can help protect body tissues against free radical damage. Free radicals are unstable atoms. To become stable, they take electrons from other atoms and form chains. These chains of free radicals cause oxidative stress to the body and cause more damage to the cells. To reduce the oxidative stress in the body, one must up the intake of antioxidants. Basil contains two important water-soluble flavonoid antioxidants, known as orientin and viceninare. These potent antioxidants strengthen immune system, protect cellular structure, DNA and delay effects of skin ageing.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>4. Beneficial for the Skin
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Basil's powerful oil helps cleanse the skin from within. The excellent skin cleanser is perfect for those with oily skin. It also helps remove dirt and impurities that clog pores. Make a paste of basil leaves, sandalwood paste and rose water. Apply the paste on your face and let it sit for 20 minutes. Was it off with cold water. The strong anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of basil would help prevent formation of acne.
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;
</strong></p><p><strong>Now that you are privy to the many benefits of basil leaves, make sure you make the most of the culinary herb in your regular diet.
